A simple reminder agent by you can add a task to a list in the Reminders.
But if you really want to get things done, you can add due date to your reminder...
or even a due location. That way you can get alerts not only for specific times,
but when you leave or arrive at specific places as well. Never forget to take the pizza out the oven,
call home when you leave work, or pick up milk when you get to the store again!,
With Reminders, you can keep track of all of life’s to-dos—when and where you need to do them.

enjoy... ;)
